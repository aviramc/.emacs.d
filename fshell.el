;;; Commentary:

;; If you give M-x fshell a prefix arg after loading this, it will create a
;; new shell buffer even if one already exists.  If you give it an explicit
;; numeric prefix arg, it will try to switch to that numbered shell buffer,
;; or create it.
;;
;; The alternative is to rename the current shell buffer and invoke M-x
;; shell, which is more keystrokes, especially if you decide to name your
;; old shell back when you're done with the newer one.

;; rms declined to add this functionality in emacs' shell.el, so I'm
;; maintaining it separately.

;;; Code:

(require 'shell)

;;;###autoload
(defvar fshell-default-make-new-shell nil
  "*If non-`nil', reverse the meaning of prefix arg to \\[fshell]")

;;;###autoload
(defvar fshell-make-shell-hook nil
  "*Forms to run in a new shell buffer just before the process is started.")

;;;###autoload
(defvar fshell-buffer-name "*shell*"
  "*Buffer name for shell process.")

(defun fshell (&optional prefix)
  "Run an inferior shell, with I/O through buffer *shell*.
The actual name of the buffer can be specified with the variable
`fshell-buffer-name', but for the sake of brevity the default will be used
in the examples below.

If buffer exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.

If buffer exists and shell process is running, just switch to buffer
 named \"*shell*\".
If an explicit numeric prefix argument is given (or this function is called
  from lisp with a numeric argument), switch to the buffer *shell*<prefix>,
  e.g. \"*shell*<2>\".  If there is no process in that buffer, start one.
If a prefix argument is given but it is not a number, create a new buffer
  and start a shell process in it.  This is the same as calling the function
  from lisp with an argument of `t'.

The previous paragraph describes the behavior of this function whenever it
is called from lisp.  If it is called interactively and the variable
`fshell-default-make-new-shell' is non-`nil', then the meaning of
non-numeric prefix arguments is reversed,
i.e. typing `\\[fshell]' without a prefix argument creates a new shell,
and `\\[universal-argument] \\[fshell]' would switch to the buffer \"*shell*\".

Program used comes from variable `explicit-shell-file-name',
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,
 or else from SHELL if there is no ESHELL.
If a file `~/.emacs_SHELLNAME' exists, it is given as initial input
 (Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the shell
  discards input when it starts up.)
The buffer is put in Shell mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See `shell-mode'.
See also the variable `shell-prompt-pattern'.

The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-sh-args'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.

Type \\[describe-mode] in the shell buffer for a list of commands."
