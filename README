Aviram's emacs definitions
==========================

Emacs definitions tested on emacs23 (23.4.1, to be exact).

These definitions should not work "out of the box", as there are Emacs lisp
packages that are not default and are not found in. These packages should be
installed manually.  Review the file init.el and see which packages you don't
have, and install them. Usually in Ubuntu these are available with apt-get,
for example:
    apt-get install git-el
will install git mode for Emacs.
